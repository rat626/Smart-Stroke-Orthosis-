# StudentEngagement
In this project, I built a full pipeline to decode student engagement from EEG and eye - tracking data, and visualized how engagement changes based on the difficulty of educational content. The data was taken from the Student Engagemen Dataset, an open source collection of data on Kaggle with learning type, EEG and eye - tracking features.
