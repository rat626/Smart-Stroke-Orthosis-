# EEG - Based Stroke Orthosis
In this project, I aimed to create a pipeline to decode intended hand movements from the EEG data of hemiparetic stroke patients, which can then be used to motorize a splint/orthosis and help open the palm and digits to retrain neural pathways involved in grasping, grip, and motor actions involving the hand. Through clinical experiences, I saw stroke patients with varying degrees of symptomology, from Broca's aphasia and right shoulder tone stemming from left brain stroke, to complete wheelchair dependency as a result of tone in the lower left leg, and complete immobility of the left hand, to the point where patients had to use their right hand to move their left upon command. By using EEG signals to decode contralateral movement, previously damaged pathways can be repaired as a patient retrains their ability to recognize their impaired hand's functionality, and gradually gain strength to the point where an orthosis is no longer needed.
